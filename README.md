# Quick Sketch

Main Features:
- Every interaction, except a few CSS hover effects, is managed by JS. HTML contains only basic DIVs.
- Adjust canvas size (square mesh density) of your canvas from 2x2 to 100x100. Re-adjusting resets canvas to initial state (deletes your magnificent artwork!)
- Start drawing immediately with black color, choose from pre-selected colors or let the app choose a completely random color.
- Rainbow mode = colors are changing constantly as you draw.
- Shading = Selected color is slowly getting darker or lighter as you draw with it. Selected option is underlined. Selecting it again or choosing a different color turns it off; selecting different shading option switches shading mode accordingly. Moreover, it is disabled in Rainbow mode.
- Canvas border color reflects currently active color (changes with shading too). Rainbow mode is an exception - here it was disabled due to rapid flasing, which might be harmful to user.
- Deletion options = Toggle eraser and erase your art pixel by pixel. Select "Clear" option to erase your whole drawing while keeping selected canvas size.

Main goals:

- Effective combination of Flexbox and Grid layouts.
- First attempt to create interactive navigation bar and learn how to use absolute positioning.
- Gain more experience with the use of different Event Listeners.
- Keeping code as clean as possible, which was crucial since this app does quiet a lot of different, but often overlaping things.
- Keeping the desing very minimalistic and functionality easy to understand.
- Import Web Icons from boxicons

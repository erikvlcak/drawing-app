# Quick Sketch

Main Features:
- Adjust canvas size ("pixel size") of your canvas.
- Start drawing with black color, choose from pre-selected colors or let the app choose a completely random color.
- Rainbow mode = colors are changing constantly as you draw.
- Color of canvas border signalizes currently active color.
- Shading = Selected color is slowly getting darker or lighter as you draw with it. Selecting new color resets this feature. Moreover, it is disabled in Rainbow mode.
- Deletion options = Toggle eraser and erase your art pixel by pixel. Select "Clear" option to erase your whole drawing while keeping selected canvas size.

Main goals:
- Effective combination of Flexbox and Grid layouts.
- First attempt to create interactive navigation bar.
- Gain more experience with the use of different Event Listeners.
- Keeping code as clean as possible, which was crucial since this app does quiet a lot of different, but often overlaping things.
- Keeping the desing very minimalistic and functionality easy to understand.
